            <p>Welcome to our website! We are dedicated to providing you with valuable information about security concepts and practices.</p>

                <h3>Authentication vs Authorization</h3>
                <p>One important aspect of security is understanding the difference between authentication and authorization:</p>
                <ul className="list-group">
                    <li className="list-group-item"><strong>Authentication:</strong> Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or entity. It confirms whether the user is who they claim to be by validating their credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or biometric data.</li>
                    <li className="list-group-item"><strong>Authorization:</strong> Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access or perform after successfully authenticating. It involves evaluating permissions associated with the authenticated identity and deciding whether the requested action or access is allowed or denied.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div className="mb-4">
                <h3>Why Firebase for Authentication?</h3>
                <p>We have chosen Firebase for authentication due to its ease of integration, robust security features, and scalability. Firebase Authentication offers ready-to-use authentication services, including email/password authentication, social sign-in, and multi-factor authentication, making it convenient for developers to implement authentication in their applications.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Understanding the distinction between authentication and authorization is crucial for implementing effective access control mechanisms and ensuring the security of systems and resources.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Other Authentication Options</h3>
                <p>While Firebase is a popular choice for authentication, there are other options available:</p>
                <ul className="list-group">
                    <li className="list-group-item">Custom Authentication Systems: Develop custom authentication systems using frameworks like Passport.js, Auth0, or Okta.</li>
                    <li className="list-group-item">OAuth Providers: Integrate with OAuth providers such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, or GitHub for authentication.</li>
                    <li className="list-group-item">LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): Implement LDAP for centralized authentication and directory services.</li>
                    <li className="list-group-item">OpenID Connect: Use OpenID Connect for federated authentication and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each authentication option has its advantages and considerations, and the choice depends on factors such as development requirements, security needs, and scalability.</p>
